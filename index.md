## About Me

I am a researcher in Reinforcement Learning and Control methodology. Currently a Postdoc at Boston University, where I'm advised by Prof. Pacchiano Aldo. 


- I have a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from KTH Royal Insitute of Technology (Stockholm), where I was supervised by Prof. Proutiere Alexandre at the Division of Decision and Control Systems.  
- Due to my past experiences, and interests, I have a versatile background, with both theoretical and practical expertise.
- Programming languages: Python, C, C++

## Research Interests

My research interests are in statistical learning, particularly in the areas of learning for sequential decision making.

- **Reinforcement Learning:** adaptive/pure exploration (theoretical and practical), self-play RL, robust/adversarial RL and bandit algorithms.
- **Adaptive and Robust Control**: adaptive control (e.g., MRAC/L1), adaptive MPC and non-linear control.

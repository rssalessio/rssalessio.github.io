## About Me

I am a researcher in Reinforcement Learning and Control methodology. Currently a Postdoc at Boston University, where I'm advised by Prof. Pacchiano Aldo. 


I have a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from KTH Royal Insitute of Technology (Stockholm), where I was supervised by Prof. Proutiere Alexandre at the Division of Decision and Control Systems.

## Research Interests

- **Reinforcement Learning:** adaptive exploration (theoretical and practical), bandit algorithms
- **Adaptive Control**: adaptive control, MPC and non-linear control
- **Machine Learning:** meta-learning and curriculum learning
